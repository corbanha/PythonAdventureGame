A basic console game in Python to practice some basic Python concepts

The program itself is a simple RPG console game where the user goes through 10 stages or quests until they beat the last one. Each quest either consists of buying items at the trading post, or fighting different and diverse enemies. 

Here are the basic concepts that are practiced in this project:
- console I/O
- Reading/Writing to file
- Classes
- Generators and Comprehensions
- Importing library and custom modules
- Exception raising and handling
